	<h3 id="purpose"> The general introduction to my new site:</h3>
		<p>
		 I want to build a new blog kind website as a branch of my portfolio website. The main purpose of the website is about my life, my traveling and may work as my diary as well. I will remove the current traveling page from my portfolio site into my new blog site. My blog website will be a diverse collection and more personal. </p>

 The intended audience will be my close friends and mostly me. </p>

	<section class="Q3">	
	<h3 id="tone">What tone do you want for the site’s written content?</h3>
		<p>
		 There won’t be quite a lot written content on my site. I will use a more casual tone. </p>

	<section class="Q4">
	<h3 id="content">What will be goal and content of your site?</h3>
		<p>
		 Here are several goals I’d like to achieve in my blog website:
			<li> I want to have music embedded into my website.</li>
			<li>
  I want to make one page as my (partly visual narrative) diary. And create it to be interactive in a way.(possibly work with Wordpress)</li>
 <li>I want to build a page for movies/music/books that I read. Just want to archive them in a way. It might be simply a picture of them, like a picture wall. I have find a sample.</li>
<li>I want to have a section that has a user feedback page; so people can talk to me. Or something like shop that people can order something from me. Or both! (haven’t decided yet)</li>
<li>And as a DT student, I want to put some of my Processing sketch into my portfolio site if possible. So people can interact with them.</li> </p>

		<p>Then maybe the five different categories of the navigation bar become five different doors.</p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>Or more ideally, it will be something like this <a href="http://www.nicolassassoon.com/INDEX/INDEX.html">website</a>. I want to build the website like an architecture. So when user scroll down, a different room comes up. It's like each part of the website is an individual room!

	    <p>
	    	Here is a general site map that I created, which shows where each category directs users to.
			Basically I want to create a blog kind website which connects with my portfolio site.
